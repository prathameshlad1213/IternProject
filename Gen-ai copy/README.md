# Mit-AI
Problem Statement
To address the challenge of fragmented and inaccessible academic and institutional information for
students, this project aims to develop an AI-powered mobile application for MITAOE. The app will
consolidate and provide comprehensive access to subject-wise syllabi, passing criteria, teaching staff
details, departmental vision and mission, and overall academic structure. By leveraging technologies
like LLMs and RAG, the system will offer personalized and efficient information retrieval,
improving student awareness, academic planning, and institutional transparency.
Introduction
• The AI-Powered Academic Information System is designed to enhance the student experience at
MITAOE by providing personalized access to academic content, including subject-wise syllabi,
teaching staff details, passing criteria, and departmental vision and mission, all tailored for easy
and centralized access.
• It leverages advanced technologies such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Natural Language
Processing (NLP), and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze queries and fetch
accurate, context-aware academic information. The system is developed using the LangChain
framework for smart content retrieval and generative response generation.
• Using tools like Streamlit for the user interface and semantic search through vector databases, the
system enables efficient and intuitive navigation of institutional data. It aims to make academic
information more accessible, transparent, and personalized for every student at MITAOE.
Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop an AI-powered academic information system that
centralizes and personalizes access to institutional and academic data for MITAOE students. The system
aims to:
• To develop an academic Generative AI (Gen AI) model using Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate and context-specific academic
information.
• To provide personalized access to subject syllabi, passing criteria, teaching staff details, departmental
visions and missions, and other college-related data.
• To create an AI-powered virtual assistant that interacts with students in a user-friendly way to answer
academic and institutional queries in real-time, enhancing student engagement and information
accessibility.
